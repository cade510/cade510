## 👋 Hi, I'm Cade Alheim

I'm a senior Informatics student with a concentration in Computer Science at Indiana University South Bend.

🚀 I'm currently developing **HelpOut**, a Flutter-based mobile app designed to connect people with volunteer opportunities in their communities.

### 🛠️ HelpOut features include:
- Event creation and management  
- Geolocation-based filtering  
- User sign-ups and tracking  
- Firebase integration for real-time data handling

I'm passionate about building meaningful tech that brings people together.
